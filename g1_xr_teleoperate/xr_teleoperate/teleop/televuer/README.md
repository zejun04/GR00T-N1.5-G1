# TeleVuer

The TeleVuer library is a specialized version of the [Vuer](https://github.com/vuer-ai/vuer) library, designed to enable XR device-based teleoperation of Unitree Robotics robots. This library acts as a wrapper for Vuer, providing additional adaptations specifically tailored for Unitree Robotics. By integrating XR device capabilities, such as hand tracking and controller tracking, TeleVuer facilitates seamless interaction and control of robotic systems in immersive environments.

Currently, this module serves as a core component of the [xr_teleoperate](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/xr_teleoperate) library, offering advanced functionality for teleoperation tasks. It supports various XR devices, including Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest3, Pico 4 Ultra Enterprise etc., ensuring compatibility and ease of use for robotic teleoperation applications.

The image input of this library works in conjunction with the [teleimager](https://github.com/silencht/teleimager) library. We recommend using both libraries together.

## 0. 🔖 Release Note

### V4.0 🏷️ brings updates:

1. Improved Display Modes

    Removed the old “pass_through” mode. The system now supports three modes:

    - immersive: fully immersive mode; VR shows the robot's first-person view (zmq or webrtc must be enabled).

    - pass-through: VR shows the real world through the VR headset cameras; no image from zmq or webrtc is displayed (even if enabled).

    - ego: a small window in the center shows the robot's first-person view, while the surrounding area shows the real world.

2. Enhanced Immersion

    Adjusted the image plane height for immersive and ego modes to provide a more natural and comfortable VR experience

### V3.0 🏷️ brings updates:
1. Added `pass_through` interface to enable/disable the pass-through mode.
2. Support `webrtc` interface to enable/disable the webrtc streaming mode.
3. Use `render_to_xr` method (adjust from `set_display_image`) to send images to XR device.

### V2.0 🏷️ brings updates:

1. Image transport is now by reference instead of external shared memory.
2. Renamed the get-data function from `get_motion_state_data` to `get_tele_data`.
3. Fixed naming errors (`waist` → `wrist`)
4. Var name align with **vuer** conventions.
5. Streamlined the data structure: removed the nested `TeleStateData` and return everything in the unified `TeleData`.
6. Added new image-transport interfaces such as `set_display_image`.

## 2. 📦 Install

### 2.1 📥 Install televuer repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silencht/televuer
cd televuer
pip install -e . # or pip install .
```


### 2.2 🔑 Generate Certificate Files

The televuer module requires SSL certificates to allow XR devices (such as Pico / Quest / Apple Vision Pro) to connect securely via HTTPS / WebRTC.

1. For Pico / Quest XR Devices

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
# Check the Generated Files
$ ls
build  cert.pem  key.pem  LICENSE  pyproject.toml  README.md  src  test
```

2. For Apple Vision Pro

```bash
openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 365 -out rootCA.pem -subj "/CN=xr-teleoperate"
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out server.csr -subj "/CN=localhost"
vim server_ext.cnf
# Add the following content (make sure IP.2 matches your host machine’s IP address, which you can find with ifconfig or similar):
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = localhost
IP.1 = 192.168.123.164
IP.2 = 192.168.123.2
# Then sign the certificate:
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out cert.pem -days 365 -sha256 -extfile server_ext.cnf
# Check the Generated Files
$ ls
build  cert.pem  key.pem  LICENSE  pyproject.toml  README.md  rootCA.key  rootCA.pem  rootCA.srl  server.csr  server_ext.cnf  src  test
# Use AirDrop to copy rootCA.pem to your Apple Vision Pro device and install it manually as a trusted certificate.
```

3. 🧱 Allow Firewall Access

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8012
```

### 2.3 🔐 Configure Certificate Paths (Choose One Method)

You can tell televuer where to find the certificate files using either environment variables or a user config directory.

This configuaration could be shared with [teleimager](https://github.com/silencht/teleimager) module in [xr_teleoperate](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/xr_teleoperate) repo.

1. User Configuration Directory (Recommended)

```bash
# this repo belongs to xr_teleoperate, so we use its config dir
mkdir -p ~/.config/xr_teleoperate/
cp cert.pem key.pem ~/.config/xr_teleoperate/
```
2. Environment Variable Configuration (Optional)

```bash
# This makes the configuration persistent for future terminal sessions.
echo 'export XR_TELEOP_CERT="your_file_path/cert.pem"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export XR_TELEOP_KEY="your_file_path/key.pem"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

3. Default Behavior

If neither of the above methods is used, televuer will look for the certificate files from the function parameters or fall back to the default paths within the module.

## 3. 🧐 Test

```bash
python test_televuer.py 
# or 
python test_tv_wrapper.py

# First, use Apple Vision Pro or Pico 4 Ultra Enterprise to connect to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.
# Next, open safari / pico browser, enter https://host machine's ip:8012/?ws=wss://host machine's ip:8012
# for example, https://192.168.123.2:8012?ws=wss://192.168.123.2:8012
# Use the appropriate method (hand gesture or controller) to click the "pass-through" button in the bottom-left corner of the screen.

# Press Enter in the terminal to launch the program.
```
